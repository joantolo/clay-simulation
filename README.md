# ClaySimulation


*In this repository I show just some samples of the project because I cannot update all the framework.*


<p>Here you can find the implementation of the elastoplasticity constraint and the collision particles-hands constraint. They are defined with a c# file and its compute shader.</p>
  <p>You can see how the hands are rasterized as ghost particles in the SimulationPointCloudCollider.cs also.</p>
